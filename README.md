# Flight Price Prediction

This project aims to predict flight prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to flights, and the model is trained to estimate flight prices based on these features.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
  - Load the dataset from a CSV file.
  - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (flight prices).
  - Use scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Train a linear regression model.
  - Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

- **Visualization of Results**:
  - Compare actual vs. predicted flight prices using scatter plots.

## Libraries
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
